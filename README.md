# omz-git (fork / codebrauer edit)

This is an [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) plugin 
that shortens the branch name usefully in order to keep the prompt short(er).

To install this plugin, you can use the following command:

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/tnwinc/codebrauer/master/install-plugin.sh)"
```

You can then add the plugin to your `.zshrc`. Alternatively, you can clone the repo into your `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins` directory and do the same.

## Branch naming

By default, this plugin will truncate branch names to 20 characters total. Also by default, if detected, the team name at the beginning of the branch will not be displayed. However, it does make sure that e.g. the Pivotal Tracker ID will always be included at the end.

So, with the default settings, a branch like `pt-custom-list-doesnt-return-results-if-there-are-values-for-hire-date-96306202` will be displayed as `pt-custom-liâ€¦96306202`.


## Options

This is customizable in a few ways. You can set these options using:
```
git config --global oh-my-zsh.<option name> <value>
```

* `max-branch-length` - the maximum length of branch name that will be displayed in your prompt. Defaults to 20 with manual install, set to 30 by install script.
* `prefix-regex` - the first match for this regex will be removed. By default, no regex is used.
* `prefix-length` - removes n characters from the beginning of the branch name. Useful if a lot of your branches have a fix-length prefix. Defaults to 0.
* `suffix-length` - ensures that n characters at the end of the branch name are included in the output. Useful if you have an ID or other fixed-length identifier appended to the branch name. Defaults to 0 with manual install, set to 6 by install script.
